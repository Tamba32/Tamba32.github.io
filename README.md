## Tamba's BitSight Code Sample

I used the [Create React App NPM Package](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

I stopped coding once I reached the 2 hour time limit.
I finished answering the problem, however if I had more time, I would have also: 

- Included props validation
- Implemented better styling
- Commented my code
- Tested my API calls
