# Code Sample

### What I Did

I stopped coding once I reached the 2 hour time limit.
I finished answering the problem, however if I had more time, I would have also: 

- Included props validation
- Implemented better styling
- Commented my code
- Tested my API calls

### Problem I Was Solving

GitHub offers official API v3 (https://developer.github.com/v3/) . All API access is over
HTTPS, and accessed from the api.github.com domain. All data is sent and received as
JSON. This API supports unauthenticated requests, the rate limit allows you to make up
to 60 requests per hour.

Write a webapp that uses the API to show the most active repositories and users.

#### More Details
Create a button with an id of “hot_repo” that upon click will refresh the content of a
tablelike div with the top 5 repositories with the most stars created last month. From
highest to lowest. Include columns for, at least, the following attributes id, name,
description and number of stars.

Create a button with an id of “prolific_users” that upon click will refresh the content of a
tablelike div with the top 5 most active users by followers created over the last year.
From highest to lowest. Include columns for, at least, the following attributes id, login,
avatar image and number of followers.

Automatically refresh the number of followers every 2 minutes.
